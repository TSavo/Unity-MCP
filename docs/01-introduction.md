# Introduction to Unity-MCP

## Overview

Unity-MCP is a bridge between Unity and AI assistants using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables AI assistants like Claude to interact with Unity game environments through a standardized interface, allowing for AI-assisted game development, automated testing, scene analysis, and runtime debugging.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Unity-MCP is to provide a standardized way for AI assistants to:

1. **Execute code** in the Unity runtime environment
2. **Inspect game objects** and their components
3. **Analyze scene hierarchies** and structures
4. **Run tests** and receive results
5. **Invoke methods** on game objects and components
6. **Modify game state** during runtime

## Key Benefits

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Enable AI assistants to understand and modify Unity projects
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests from AI assistants and analyze results
- **Runtime Inspection**: Examine the state of a running Unity game
- **Code Execution**: Execute arbitrary C# code in the Unity environment
- **Standardized Interface**: Use the MCP standard for compatibility with various AI assistants
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Allow both AI-to-Unity and Unity-to-AI communication

## Four-Component Architecture

Unity-MCP implements a four-component architecture:

1. **MCP STDIO Client**: A command-line tool that implements the MCP protocol using the official TypeScript SDK
2. **Web Server with Persistence**: A long-running service that maintains state across sessions
3. **Unity Integration**: A plugin for Unity that executes code and communicates with the Web Server
4. **Unity SDK**: A C# library that Unity developers can use to interact with the system

Each component has a specific role in the architecture, and they work together to provide a complete solution for AI-Unity interaction.

## Communication Flow

The communication flow between Claude and Unity is as follows:

```
Claude <-- stdio --> MCP STDIO Client <-- HTTP --> Web Server <-- HTTP/WebSockets --> Unity Integration
                                                       ^
                                                       |
                                                       v
                                                  Unity SDK (used by Unity developers)
```

This architecture provides several benefits:
- Claude interacts with the MCP STDIO client using the standard MCP protocol
- The web server maintains state between interactions
- Unity only needs to communicate with the web server, not directly with Claude
- Unity developers can use a simple SDK to interact with the system
